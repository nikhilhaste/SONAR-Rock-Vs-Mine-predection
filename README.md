# Rock Vs Mine prediction

# OBJECTIVE

This project utilizes logistic regression to differentiate underwater objects (rocks or mines) using sonar technology. It involves preprocessing
data, extracting features, and implementing the model. Feature selection is employed to identify critical acoustic features, while performance
is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The aim is to enhance underwater security by improving the reliability of sonar
systems in distinguishing between harmless geological formations and potentially dangerous mines.
